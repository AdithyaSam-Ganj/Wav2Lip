# Wav2Lip - Task 1 OpeninApp / Listed 

This is a project to lip sync audio file with video file for an interview task OpeninApp / Listed. 

## Task 
I was asked to lip sync a video file from youtube with an audio file that was provided.

## Data Files 
 The final lip synced file can be found Output_File.mp4. The input files are "Input_audio_file.mp4", for audio, and "Input_video_file.mp4" ,for video. 

## Code 
  I have used a jupyter notebook to implement the task.

#### All the dependencies and the modules are imported in the notebook.  

  I have used Wav2Lip for lip syncing the audio with the video file. More information can be found in this link "https://github.com/Rudrabha/Wav2Lip"

The .ipynb notebook contains all the code including the comments that are necessary for understanding the code.
